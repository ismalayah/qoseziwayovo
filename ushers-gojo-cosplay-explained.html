Recommended Videos In recent years, anime has been going more and more into the mainstream. Jujutsu Kaisen has previously proven that its fandom is a force to be reckoned with. One day in late Sept. 2023, chapter 236 came out and the Internet was set on fire."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

One day in late Sept. 2023, chapter 236 came out and the Internet was set on fire. Countless anime-only fans were spoiled by the loudmouth, over-excited section of fans who made it their mission to fill every related comment section across an array of platforms with the massive spoiler. The hashtag “#Gojover” was spammed everywhere. Not to mention, some people’s immaturity went as far as sending hate comments and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">death threats to creator Gege Akutami</a> for the unexpected twist.</p><p data-characters=121 data-current-count=121 data-injectable=false>But, admittedly, the defeat of Gojo against Sukuna also spawned some undeniably funny memes, some from unlikely accounts:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=421 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>me and lily are so excited for <a href=#>#jjk237</a> <a href=#>#JujutsuKaisen</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/a7hNFbLGAq</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/D3pfIlb6ro</a></p>— Duolingo (@duolingo) <a href=#>September 26, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=251 data-injectable=false>Even more impressive than having Duolingo chime in with their own chapter 236 meme was the fact that the fandom has managed to drag no one other than Usher into it. How? And are the fans expecting more from the singer now that he has given them a nod?</p><h2 id=h-who-s-coming-home data-injectable=false>Who’s coming home?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=551 data-injectable=true><a title=@usher href=#>@usher</a><p>RIP Gojo, We’re standing next to you…<a title=satorugojo href=#>#satorugojo</a> <a title=jujustukaisen href=#>#jujustukaisen</a> <a title=cominghome href=#>#cominghome</a></p><a title="♬ Standing Next to You - Usher Remix - Jung Kook & USHER" href=#>♬ Standing Next to You – Usher Remix – Jung Kook & USHER</a></figure><p data-characters=218 data-current-count=218 data-injectable=false>Anime fans have honed the skill of “memefying” certain songs as part of fan edit videos. One example would be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Melanie Martinez</a>’s “Play Date,” which spawned an endless stream of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">anime edits of a similar style</a>.</p><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=544 data-injectable=true>When <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gojo was released from the Prison Realm</a>, his fans all felt something similar, and this generalized feeling was perfectly encapsulated by Usher’s “Hey Daddy (Daddy’s Home).” Hence, a new trend emerged. And this lighthearted trend would have a more concrete practical effect than most people could’ve anticipated.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=495 data-current-count=795 data-injectable=true>Sure, “Daddy” Gojo was not “home” for long <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">before he was severed in half</a>, but nevertheless the attention his character has gotten over the years, especially in the last year or so, could probably be called unprecedented when it comes to anime series. So much so that the trend even reached Usher. It would be impossible to tell when the singer became aware of how his song was being incorporated into the Jujutsu Kaisen fandom or when he decided to publicly embrace it with his cosplay.</p><p data-characters=115 data-current-count=115 data-injectable=false>But this only awakened the fans’ thirst for one more little tribute. Hence, they have made a sincere request.</p><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=556 data-injectable=false>A <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Change.org petition</a> is circulating in an attempt to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">have Usher perform “Daddy’s Home”</a> in memory of the late Special Grade sorcerer at the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2024 Super Bowl Halftime Show</a>. As of Jan. 21, it has collected over 35 thousand signatures. So, will the singer fulfill their wish? Only Feb. 11, 2024, will confirm whether Jujutsu Kaisen fans will once again managed to use their collective power and their undying love for Gojo to make history.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6uqqGdoqh6qLvJqGScp6OluaLFjJ6vqaSRnrumsI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
