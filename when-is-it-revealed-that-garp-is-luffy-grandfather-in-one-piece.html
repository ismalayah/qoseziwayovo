Recommended Videos Season one of the live-action One Piece series more or less faithfully adapted the source material, much to the delight of fans and critics alike. That being said, Netflix’s One Piece did make a few changes, including revealing this important character’s relationship to one of the Straw Hats much earlier than in both the anime and the manga.

Luffy’s grandfather occurs much later than it does in the live-action. In the live-action, Garp is shown chasing down Luffy throughout the entire first season, with Luffy’s old friend and new Marine recruit Koby at the Vice-Admiral’s side. While some version of this chase does happen in the manga and anime, it’s mostly alluded to offscreen.</p><h2 id=h-when-do-we-find-out-garp-is-luffy-s-grandfather-in-one-piece data-injectable=false>When do we find out Garp is Luffy’s grandfather in One Piece?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Monkey-D-Garp.jpg><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=656 data-injectable=true>In the Netflix show, Luffy reveals Garp is his grandfather in episode 4. The reveal happens when the Marines catch up to the Going Merry, shortly before the Straw Hats land at Baratie. The Straw Hats are, understandably, shocked by this revelation; long-time One Piece fans were also surprised since the reveal plays out differently in the manga and anime.</p><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=312 data-injectable=false>The Straw Hats first find out <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Garp is Luffy’s grandfather in the Post-Enies Lobby Arc</a> (chapter 431 in the manga, and episodes 313/314 in the anime, respectively).
