Keep going MBJ!”</p><p>“Corny where????? MBJ got the last laugh………. SUCCESS is the best revenge.”</p><p>For those who missed the viral <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">moment</a> that has his admirers craving “corn,” during the Atlanta premiere on Feb. 23, Jordan had an interesting run-in with a former classmate, radio personality Lore’l. According to “The Morning Rush” co-host, she and the “Journal for Jordan” lead attended Chad Science Academy in his hometown of Newark, New Jersey.</p><p>As Lore’l recalled their brief history, she was interrupted by Jordan, who interjected with, “Oh yeah, I was the corny kid, right?” Lore’l was adamant that she “did not say that” and instead that she was “misquoted for sure.”</p><p>The actor was referencing a 2021 discussion that took place on the “Undressing Room” podcast, where she admitted to joining in with other classmates who used to clown Jordan.</p><p>“We teased him all the damn time because his name was Michael Jordan. Let’s start there, and he was no Michael Jordan,” recalled Lore’l. “And he also would come to school with a head shot. We lived in Newark; that’s the hood. We would make fun of him, like, ‘What you gonna do with your stupid headshot!?’ And now look at him!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Michael B.
