The impending “Pickle Arc” is inarguably the most anticipated aspect of season two, and — in great news for impatient fans — it will arrive in tandem with part one of season two, titled “The Tale of Pickle & The Pickle War Saga,” on Wednesday, July 26th. The second half of the season, titled “The Father VS Son Saga,” will arrive right around a month later, on Thursday, August 24th.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6wn56mXZm8pr%2BMrJyaq5%2BjenN5zp9km5mbnnqprc2mmGabn6KybrvUrWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
