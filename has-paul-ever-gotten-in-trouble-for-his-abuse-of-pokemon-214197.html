One thing that truly establishes his jerkass persona is of course the way he treats his Pokemon. The biggest crime in that department was the way he treated Chimchar. I won't get into too much detail there because you know what happened.</p><p>But one thing that confuses me is what Pokemon authority figures such as Nurse Joy, Officer Jenny, Professor's Oak, Elm, Birch, Rowan, etc could have done about him. Is it possible that they knew about his abuse of his Pokemon? Couldn't they suspend his Pokemon licence? What do they personally think of his rotten attitude?</p><p>Maybe it has happened before. Maybe not. I can imagine that in the real world, someone like Paul would have become a juvenile delinquent, get thrown into detention centers, jail cells, etc.</p><p>Has Paul ever been disciplined for his behavior in the show? Do you think he should have been?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHyprdJmp5qtnGKyt7HRZp6orKSau261zWarq6ell7mmecWoqWagmah6oq7UrJxmp5ZivbC3xKamp2ZiZoFyhZZo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
