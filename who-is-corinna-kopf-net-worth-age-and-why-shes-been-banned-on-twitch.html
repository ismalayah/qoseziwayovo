In addition to her Instagram success, Kopf has also gained a significant following on platforms like Twitter, Twitch, and OnlyFans. While Kopf <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">keeps her personal life relatively private</a>, there are some essential details that any devoted fan should know about this popular streamer, and here is everything you need to know.</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>Born on December 1, 1995, in Palatine, Illinois, the 26-year-old model first started to gain popularity on YouTube for being part of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">David Dobrik</a>’s squad in 2016. Known for doing risky and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">even life-threatening pranks</a>, Dobrik’s channel had a miscellaneous assortment of content.</p><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=608 data-injectable=true>Over the course of time, Dobrik’s squad members started leaving the group one by one with the number of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">controversies and allegations against the YouTuber</a> continuously arising. To this day, Kopf is one of the few remaining members of the squad who defends Dobrik, crediting him as the person who opened her doors to fame.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=350 data-injectable=false>However, since shifting to creating gaming content, Corinna has barely made an appearance in Dobrik’s vlogs, focusing on her career on Twitch instead. Nevertheless, her streaming career has proven to have had a rocky start from the second she joined Twitch, thus starting her long and conflictual battle with the streaming platform until this day.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Why was Corinna Kopf banned from Twitch and where is she now?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=650 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by sid (@sidneyeweka)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>In 2019, the influencer received her first ban from the streaming platform, immediately signing a contract with Facebook Gaming instead. During that time, Corinna’s Fortnite streams did incredibly well, and after two years, Kopf has finally made her way into Twitch again, hopeful for some improvement in her relationship with the platform.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Corinna Kopf’s second ban</h3><p data-characters=533 data-current-count=881 data-injectable=true>Upon making “just talking,” and gaming videos, Kopf’s popularity exponentially increased on the streaming platform, with her videos amounting to a huge number of viewers as well as followers. However, that was all cut short when in May, just two months after joining back on the platform, Corinna received a 24-hour ban on Twitch, for having “inappropriate attire.” This ban, although short-lived, has once again damaged the streamer’s relationship with the platform, who took to Twitter to share her frustration.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Pouty-Girl-tweet.png><h3 data-injectable=false>How Corinna Kopf responded to the Twitch ban</h3><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=611 data-injectable=true>The streamer would go on to humorously add emojis to the caption “ain’t the first time”, referring to her 2019 ban, which was caused by a two-year resurfaced video. During this time, however, the model has kept busy with her active Instagram presence, as well as her main source of income, OnlyFans.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=327 data-injectable=false>At the time of writing, Kopf’s Twitch channel is now up with the most recent videos dating back to early June of 2023. Even though her channel has still been re-established, in February 2023, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dexerto</a> announced the streamer would now be holding her live streams on Kick, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">alongside the former-biggest star on Twitch, xQc.</a></p><h2 data-injectable=false>What is Corinna Kopf’s net worth?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=627 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by DAVID DOBRIK (@daviddobrik)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=529 data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true>Luckily, the ban has not affected Kopf’s value. When it comes to the model’s net worth, everything seems to be positively looking up. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CelebrityNetWorth</a> has concluded Corinna’s net worth to be $12 million as of 2023. In August 2021, Kopf admitted to earning over $4 million on OnlyFans alone, and if it is indeed true then that would make the streamer one of the highest-paid creators on the adult platform. On Logan Paul’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Impaulsive</a> podcast, Kopf has also admitted that she still earns over $1 million on OnlyFans.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=272 data-current-count=272 data-injectable=false>Since then, fans have been able to keep up with the influencer on social media and OnlyFans, as her latest streams were made nearly a month ago, which is not surprising when taking into consideration how displeased a creator would be to have their content unfairly banned.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmm5%2Bntq%2B6wGaiqKiWYrumwIywpqusmGKuqLGMmqWdZaedxm6%2Fx56qZpqVmrtursCnpZ6cXaS7bsDWoqucoF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
