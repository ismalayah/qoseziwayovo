Gotti and Youngsta were offended by the title of Young Dolph’s subsequent debut album, King of Memphis. A flurry of diss tracks followed from each camp. Blac Youngsta already generated controversy prior to releasing “I’m Assuming” for continuing to perform Dolph diss track “Shake Sum” at the Aces of Dallas nightclub only weeks after his death.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://twitter.com/lfeofash/status/1472728593277018117</figure><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=749 data-injectable=true>Blac was a “person of interest” in an investigation that followed a shooting incident involving Young Dolph in February 2017. While in Charlotte, NC for a performance, Dolph’s vehicle was riddled by over 100 rounds. The rapper stated that he believed he only survived the assault due to the SUV’s armored paneling. Although he and two other men were arrested, Youngsta and the others were released due to a lack of evidence.</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=214 data-injectable=false>Dolph was gunned down last month, shortly before the Thanksgiving holiday. So far no arrests have been made in the case. The city of Memphis recently honored the rapper’s memory by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">naming a street after him</a>.</p><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=505 data-injectable=true>“I’m Assuming” does not specifically mention Young Dolph, but it is a song that is rife with violent imagery such as “I been a street n**** that murder s*** … I’m on the verge, ’bout to purge with the young n*****. They stackin’ bodies.”</p><p data-characters=171 data-current-count=171 data-injectable=false>Although Blac Youngsta has yet to make any comment on his newly released video he did respond on Instagram to criticism of his recent “Shake Sum” performance.</p><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=494 data-injectable=true>“I’m the type of n***a who ain’t neva sat back and looked for nobody to feel sorry fa me! I come from the heart of South Memphis where you get no sympathy, don’t even know what that is,” wrote the rapper. “With that being said, I could give 2 fucks what the world think about me.”</p><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=234 data-injectable=false><strong>Update Dec. 22</strong>&nbsp;<strong>11:51am</strong>&nbsp;We mistakenly identified Blac Youngsta as co-founder of Yo Gotti’s Collective Music Group. Youngsta is the founder of Heavy Camp, a record label imprint under Collective Music Group. We regret the error.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46bo5qbXa68trrGrKuaq12jsrix0q1kr6GUmrxuvsSop56mo2LBqbGMn6meq5hixLDBzZ2qZqeWYsawwc2gZJ2nnKW1tHnMrqmdnaJk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
