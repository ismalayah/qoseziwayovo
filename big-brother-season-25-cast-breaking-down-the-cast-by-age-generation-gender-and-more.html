The season began airing on Aug. 2 and with one of the most diverse groups of houseguests yet; opening with the first hearing-impaired contestant, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the first female participant over 60 years old</a>, the first Australian, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the first Sikh</a>, and the first guest from Appalachia to appear on the show. That’s a lot of firsts, but there’s one more worth mentioning. On this season of Big Brother, half of the houseguests skew on the “older” side and are over 30 years old.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=344 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>Most seasons of the show feature younger cast members, with an average age of about 25. Having an even amount of older contestants should make the alliances all the more interesting; with more contestants over 30, there’s even a chance we’ll see the first over-30 winner since Kaycee (who was just 30 at the time) won in Season 20.</p><p data-characters=222 data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true>Like most seasons, Season 25 has an equal number of men and women cast members competing for honor, glory, and of course, that $750,000 cash prize.
