The clique accepted, but only played nice in order to get Jenna to finish Tom-Tom's school assignment. The group's cruel prank of blindfolding Jenna and tricking her into staying in her closet while they left prompts Jenna to make a wish to be a grownup. The next day, Jenna wakes up as a 30-year-old version of herself in 2004.</p><p dir=ltr>Larson was also asked by <a href=#>ET</a> about "13 Going on 30" during the "Avengers: Endgame" red-carpet premiere. The actor had nothing but positive words. "I remember it was like the moment when I realized that I really wanted to direct," she said. "I remember paying a lot of attention to where the camera was and the camera moves, thinking about how I would have cut it together and then seeing the movie and seeing how it differed from what I thought."</p><p>The film's <a href=#>star Jennifer Garner</a> also recalled Larson and other young actors from the film, including "Pretty Little Liars" star <a href=#>Ashley Benson</a>, in an <a href=#>Instagram</a> post on the 15th anniversary of the iconic movie. "The movie benefitted from the performances of so many young actresses. Open and twinkly-magical then — now, 15 years later, they are ruling the world," Garner wrote, tagging Larson and others.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEpaCsrF6YvK57knJnb29iZMGpsYyimqimmZh6rrvVopxmsZ%2Bqeqmtw2alqGWZmbKiecGroJ5lnJa%2FtLvNZq6aq12eu3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
