She has performed in many TV shows like CSI: NY, Shark, Numb3rs, and Close to Home. She has kept on having recurring roles in Veronica Mars. In the short film, It’s a Mall World, Agron appeared as Harper and also in the second season of the TV series Heroes as the head cheerleader. She has also been one of the hosts to the music festival named Chickens in Love. Agron was among the many Hollywood stars, who were the face of the Wal-Mart’s Ocean Pacific’s marketing campaign. This campaign was started in all the leading fashion magazines of the US like the Vogue, Cosmopolitan, and Elle. Her most notable role till date which has made her a popular face has been the character of Quinn Fabray as a cheerleader for Glee.</p><p>She has always maintained privacy about her personal life.
