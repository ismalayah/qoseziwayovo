I really just wanted to see Sobble's evolutions, but then more Pokemon like Nickit and Toxel started leaking, and I couldn't resist looking. Before I knew it, I'd seen so many Pokemon I thought I may as well keep checking back to see them all! I did have a lot of fun in the r/SwShLeaks subreddit - there was a real buzz of excitement and positive vibes there - but I also kind of feel like I was robbed of the experience of discovering them myself. The worst part was seeing Eternatus' Pokedex entry about "Rose's meddling", which pretty much spoiled the entire plot.<p>At one point, I was actually considering not watching any more official trailers after the Zacian and Zamazenta reveal. I was worried they might pull another Sun and Moon and reveal almost everything in the trailers. They didn't, but then I ended up spoiling everything for myself anyway...</p><p>I hope I can have the self-discipline not to look at any leaks when Gen 9 comes out. I may look at leaks for Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, however, because I want to know what is and isn't included in them before buying. If there's anything missing that could be sold separately as DLC later, like the Distortion World, that might deter me.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHyxu8qepKimXZe%2FqrjLopinrF2ZtqK5zqebZpmemXq0tMinoKefXaWyor7LZp6eppWnrq15w6KqnK2jqLawuo1rb21xZmZ8sa3GnmRwbg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
