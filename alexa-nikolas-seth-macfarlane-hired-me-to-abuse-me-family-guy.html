Family Guy regularly features actors in guest-starring roles and several high-profile actresses that have worked for either studio have appeared on the show including Amanda Bynes, Ashley Tisdale, Ariana Grande, and Emily Osment but given the extremely long list of Family Guy guest stars, there doesn’t appear to be a clear pattern of behavior at this time.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ask Seth and friends about his bodyguard at his bedroom fucking door.

Nikolas does not make it clear if this was a room at MacFarlane’s residence or at the Family Guy studio.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>This industry devoured me. It hopes you stay silent. It hopes you don’t remember. Sometimes through feeding you alcohol when you are 18. Through “dating” you after but really it’s just to cover up the abusers tracks.
