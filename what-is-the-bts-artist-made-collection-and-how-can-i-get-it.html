Recommended Videos If you’ve only recently become acquainted with the biggest group in the music industry, you may not know what I’m referring to. But trust me when I tell you that every single ARMY on the face of the earth experienced a real-life Hunger Games as we tried to get our hands on this collection of merch that is, redundantly put, extremely overpriced."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

This assortment of goodies was crafted and sold in 2022, as each BTS member chose and designed every single item in their individual bundles, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">showcasing their creativity and personality</a>. Needless to say, it sold out in minutes.</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>The items include an array of options, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">such as clothing items for nearly every member</a>, bags (V and J-Hope’s), earrings (Jimin), wind chimes (RM), pillows (SUGA), and even a mood lamp with exclusive voice lines said by Jungkook. Fans are allowed to buy the items individually or in a bundle – that is, if they manage to get their hands on the merch.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Where to get the BTS artist-made collection?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/bts-proof.jpg><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>Like most things BTS-related, the items are available on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Weverse shop</a>, but for a limited time. After its first run in 2022, the merch became available just a few hours ago, and most items are still up on the site, available for purchase. Depending on your location, the merchandise can be purchased on the Korean shop, a U.S.-based shop, and the global online shop for everyone else.</p><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=742 data-injectable=true>The value of the items ranges from 28 dollars to 135 dollars, and although the prices weren’t necessarily set by the artists, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the company sure knows that fans will ultimately succumb to buying this specific merch</a>, especially after we’ve all been lured in by videos and images of them creating each of the bundles that perfectly represent them.</p><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=367 data-injectable=false>This all means that we don’t know for how long the items will be available, so you might want to hurry. It may be a few hours, days, or even weeks before they sell out – though I doubt it. This will likely be the last time these limited items will be on the market, and sadly, it will also be one of the last few gifts from the boys until the reunion in 2025.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZaSdsm6u06xkmqqknsC1ecyam55lk6S5rbHCraCopl2Wu6V5x6iuZpuRo3qqecaeq2ahpGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
