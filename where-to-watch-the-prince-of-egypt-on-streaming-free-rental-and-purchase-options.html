The movie was a retelling of Moses’ story from the Bible, chronicling how he was adopted by the Egyptian royal family after he was found by the river as a newborn infant.

The Prince of Egypt also received a nomination from the American Film Institute for 2004’s “AFI’s 100 Years… 100 Songs.”</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=572 data-injectable=true>So with the amount of recognition&nbsp;The Prince of Egypt&nbsp;has received, is it possible to watch this iconic Dreamworks film on streaming?

Perhaps those short videos could convince you whether this film is worth watching.</p><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=true>Unfortunately, don’t expect it to be on Netflix despite the streaming service having a plethora of Dreamworks content like the Madagascar franchise, Kung Fu Panda, Shrek, etc. Instead, if you want to watch this animated recreation of the Moses story, it is available to be streamed on Peacock and Roku. Peacock announced on Twitter recently that the film is accessible to that streaming service so feel free to relive this Biblical moment.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Who else watches The Prince of Egypt every year around Passover? ✋ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/NhuUPzVVCv</a></p>— Peacock (@peacock) <a href=#>April 5, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=709 data-injectable=true>For international viewers, The Prince of Egypt is able to be purchased digitally online.
