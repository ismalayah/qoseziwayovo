I’m talking “cover your eyes and squeal scary.” Or at least that’s what I do. Don’t you judge me. Okay, so scary movies have never really been my bag, but boy do I love them anyway. Masochism is an art form, friends.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=695 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=342 data-injectable=false>Since 2011, these tales of forbidden haunting have been seen all over the world, so could any of it be based on actual truth? Well, kind of. Director <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">James Wan</a> and writer Leigh Whannell have both gone on the record to say that although none of the films are technically inspired by true events, they are inspired in part by real-life stories.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-insidious-inspired-by data-injectable=false>What is Insidious inspired by?</h2><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=707 data-injectable=true>According to featurettes on the original film’s Blu-ray (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CinemaBlend</a>), and interviews with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AV Club</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">JoBlo</a> — Wan and Whannell dig directly into their creative inspirations, and some of them are real-ish. That is to say that real people have shared paranormal encounters with them over the years, and those wound up influencing Insidious outright.</p><p data-characters=42 data-current-count=42 data-injectable=false>Does anyone else feel a chill in the air?</p><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false>When discussing the supernatural, and looking at the aforementioned evidence — certain things might be true. Having said that, all the information is (to put it nicely) a bit vague. Frankly, what did you expect? No filmmaker in their right mind would come out and say that they made it all up, that’s bad for business.</p><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=692 data-injectable=true>In order to cultivate the supernatural vibe they’re going for, James Wan and Leigh Whannell have to lean on their influences. It’s much scarier to think what you’re watching up on the big screen happened to a family near you, instead of thinking it was just made up by two dudes sitting around somewhere.</p><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=361 data-injectable=false>When it’s all said and done though, does it really matter whether or not Insidious is based on a true story in the first place? These movies are meant to entertain us, and they certainly do a good job at that. With <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Insidious: The Red Door</a> releasing this July, I have no doubt that things will only get scarier for the Lambert family. Here’s hoping.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooKxlmaPAqrDIqKysZZKWwKawjKilZpldqb%2B2sYysq6iqqWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
