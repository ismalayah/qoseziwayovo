Both women are of Japanese descent and seemingly interchangeable to Frick. The restauranteur speaks to both using an over-the-top fake Japanese accent that Culturally Relevant podcast host David Chen has characterized as “buffoonish.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://twitter.com/davechensky/status/1461565715173969923</figure><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=575 data-injectable=true>Others have pointed out that the insensitive caricature seemed to serve no real purpose to further the film’s narrative.

There's an incredibly racist, seemingly pointless (other than a cheap laugh, which it got at the screening I was at) scene that mocks Asian accents.</p>— Karen Maine (@karen__maine) <a href=#>November 22, 2021</a></figure><p data-characters=537 data-current-count=837 data-injectable=true>Anderson has defended the film as representing the racist attitudes of the time, stating, “I think it would be a mistake to tell a period film through the eyes of 2021. You can’t have a crystal ball. You have to be honest to that time. Not that it wouldn’t happen right now, by the way. My mother-in-law’s Japanese, and my father-in-law is white, so seeing people speak English to her with a Japanese accent is something that happens all the time. I don’t think they even know they’re doing it.”</p><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>However, many take issue with this slice of life approach toward racist attitudes of the time and argue that a director as skilled PTA should actually establish his authorial intent. In the past two years, it’s been evident that attitudes towards Asian Americans have not changed all that much since the 70s.</p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=614 data-injectable=true>“That’s exactly what we see with the racist jokes in Licorice Pizza, where Asian viewers are ere experiencing theatrical experiences where a predominantly white audience laughs along with the racist joke instead of taking it as an uncouth relic of a bygone era,” wrote one viewer.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>racist jokes in Licorice Pizza, where Asian viewers are experiencing theatrical experiences where a predominantly white audience laughs along with the racist joke instead of taking it as an uncouth relic of a bygone era.</p>— Cory Bev (@bevilacq12) <a href=#>December 14, 2021</a></figure><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=630 data-injectable=true>This isn’t the first controversial issue to be raised by Licorice Pizza. Some on social media have definitely looked askance at the love story between the protagonists in the film, a fifteen-year-old boy and a twenty-five-year-old woman. Even several critics have described being made uncomfortable by the ten-year age gap.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Can't believe how many ppl are defending the plot of Licorice Pizza, calling it an "age gap romance". 15/25 is not an "age gap romance".</p><p>Here are two actors who are actually 25 & 15.
