He has those weird Covid toes. If you've had Covid there's like burning in your feet.

Fevers and sweating. I think the worst part for me is like PTSD, from last year. It's exactly this time last year," she said.</p><p>It comes after Sursok's emotional video message last year, in which she wept openly as she revealed McEwen had been sick with a fever for days.</p><p>"There's so many people who are struggling and going through this, and you don't think it's going to be you or your family until it is.

I know some people just feel like they have a cold or a flu, but a lot of people don't. My husband is really fit and healthy and … all the hospitals are full. Be safe, please, wear a mask. I'm begging you … just do it for someone else."</p><p>Sursok, who grew up in Sydney, started her career playing Dani Sutherland on Home And Away for four years from 2000. She scored several Australian hit singles during a short-lived music career after leaving the soap, before moving to the US in 2006 to focus on her acting career.</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-entertainment">Related articles</h2><p>More work followed, with recurring roles in The Young And The Restless, Hannah Montana and Pretty Little Liars.</p><p>Sursok and McEwen held a beachside vow renewal on the Gold Coast in December, in which the actress reflected on her husband's near-fatal battle with Covid.</p><p>"I surprised my entire family with a 10-year vow renewal. To dear Sean, on our 10-year wedding anniversary," Tammin captioned the post.</p><p>"We almost lost you a year ago.
