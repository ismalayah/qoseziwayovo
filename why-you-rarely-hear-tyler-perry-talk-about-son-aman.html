"Because these people are not famous," he said of keeping his personal relationships private. "My son's not famous." He also expressed his wish to give Aman as normal and quiet a life as he can. "I want him to know what it's like to have his own name and his own life, and not have the pressure of trying to live up to whatever or whoever your father was," he said.</p><p>Perry echoed that same sentiment&nbsp;while appearing on <a href=#>"The Rickey Smiley Morning Show"</a>&nbsp;in 2016 to talk about his family life. "Me and mom are here, we're just enjoying it. Loving every moment of it," he said of raising Aman. "I love waking up in the morning, him come running to me. Those hugs? It's life-changing." Explaining why there hasn't been any pictures of Aman online, Perry said it just wasn't their thing. "We're not the kind of parents. My son's not famous," he stressed. "We're trying very hard to keep him protected so that he can know who he is before he gets into the crazy bull crap of this social media world."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampnZoJyg46wn7JlqaTCbr7Aq5ylsV2dsqK%2BjK2wpZ2iYr2mvtGyZK2ZnKB6oq7Orqtmq5%2BjeqK5wKdm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
