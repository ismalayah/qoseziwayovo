Yes, the “Complicated” singer has been married twice and each ended in divorce.</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=588 data-injectable=true>She married the Sum 41 frontman Deryck Whibley in 2006. Their relationship lasted for four years till they divorced in 2010. Three years later, in 2013, she married the musician Chad Kroeger. The same year, the pair also starred in the music video for “Let me Go,” which was released on Oct. 15.</p><p data-characters=341 data-current-count=341 data-injectable=false>Unfortunately, their marriage didn’t last long and the couple went on to divorce after two years in 2015. Reflecting on her marriages, Lavigne told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Billboard </a>in 2018, “I love love. The way I look at it is, I married my long-term.” But the pop star wasn’t going to give up on love, and in April 2022 she got engaged to singer Mod Sun.</p><p data-characters=196 data-current-count=537 data-injectable=true>However, a few days back, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a source told People</a> that the couple is “no longer together.” The very recent breakup has sparked curiosity in the singer’s past loves. Here’s the lineup.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Deryck Whibley</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Avril-Lavigne-and-Deryck-Whibley.png><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=737 data-injectable=true>Lavigne’s very first relationship that attracted popular and tabloid attention was with Deryck Whibley, who she married in 2006. She met him for the first time at a bar at the age of 17 and as per Lavigne’s account, it was quite a memorable experience. “I made out with him the first day I met him. He gave me my first shot of Jäger. I had a tie on—it was back in the days of the tie,” she said to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a> later in 2011.</p><p data-characters=222 data-current-count=222 data-injectable=false>The “Girlfriend” singer even displayed her love for Whibley by tattooing a pink heart on her body that surrounded the letter D. The duo married after two years of dating in 2006 but decided to separate in 2009.</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=503 data-injectable=true>The reason is uncertain but a source closer to them mentioned that they had been “growing apart for months” and toward the end acted more like business partners than a married couple. It was also mentioned that Lavigne had “married too young and she finally realized that.”</p><p data-characters=110 data-current-count=110 data-injectable=false>Speaking on the subject, Lavigne shared a retrospective reflection on her relationship with Deryck. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">She wrote</a>,</p><p>“Deryck and I have been together for 6-and-a-half years. We have been friends since I was 17, started dating when I was 19, and married when I was 21. I am grateful for our time together, and I am grateful and blessed for our remaining friendship. I admire Deryck and have a great amount of respect for him. He is the most amazing person I know and I love him with all my heart. Deryck and I are separating and moving forward on a positive note.”</p><p data-characters=99 data-current-count=99 data-injectable=false>After the divorce, they have maintained a cordial relationship and remained friends for many years.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Brody Jenner</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Avril-Lavigne-and-Brody-Jenner.png><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=669 data-injectable=true>Lavigne and The Hills star Brody Jenner officially announced their relationship in early 2010, a few months after she separated from her ex-husband Deryck. They were reportedly spotted kissing in Las Vegas and per a source, were “all over each other at a nightclub.”</p><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=213 data-injectable=false>Things seemed to getting more serious when in July of the same year, Jenner exhibited a tattoo of Avril on his arm. A month later, she reciprocated by showing off her tattoo containing Brody’s name on her torso.</p><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=429 data-injectable=true>Throughout their relationship, the couple faced quite a lot of ups and downs, including sustaining severe injuries due to a bar fight, as reported in Nov. 2011. Unfortunately, the couple called it quits in Jan. 2012.</p><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=199 data-injectable=false>Lavigne’s rising fame was believed to be one of the reasons. Talking to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a>, a source said, “He told her he was tired of always being her plus-one, and always going on tour with her.”</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>“Brody said, ‘I need to stay in L.A. and get back into TV. Either scripted or reality. But I feel like a loser,’” said a source. The two went their separate ways and were never again seen together.

I walk over and he had taken a photo of himself holding the ring box and put the Polaroid in my scrapbook. Because I had stickers everywhere he put in&nbsp;‘Will you marry me?’ It was really romantic and kind of made sense.”</p><p data-characters=148 data-current-count=148 data-injectable=false>Two years later, in Sept. 2015, the couple announced their separation. Lavigne took to Instagram to announce her split from Kroeger where she wrote,</p><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=503 data-injectable=true>“It is with [a] heavy heart that Chad and I announce our separation today. Through not only the marriage, but the music as well, we’ve created many unforgettable moments. We are still, and forever will be, the best of friends, and will always care deeply for each other.

In 2021, she met <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mod Sun</a> (whose real name is Derek Smith) while working on solo song “Flames.” Lavigne told People how meeting Sun was a refreshing experience. Speaking on the subject, she said,</p><p>“I was getting out of a big relationship, and for the first time in my life, I thought I should probably be single. I got together with [Mod Sun] to write a song. We just clicked. I was like, ‘Should you be doing this?’ It was fun and exciting, and I decided, ‘F— it. Life’s short.’ I’m a Libra. I love love.”</p><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=249 data-injectable=false>They officially announced their relationship in Sept. 2021 after appearing together on the red carpet. One thing led to another and on March 27, 2022, Sun proposed to Lavigne with a dazzling designer heart-shaped diamond ring on which <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she commented</a>,</p><p>“It has the words ‘Hi Icon’ engraved in it, which were the first words he ever said to me. And it has Mod + Avril on the inside. He knew from the very beginning I wanted a heart-shaped diamond because on the day we met, we had matching heart-shaped paved rings on. We’ve worn them every day since, so it’s only fitting to have a heart-shaped engagement ring. I love it so much.”</p><p data-characters=29 data-current-count=29 data-injectable=false>About the proposal, she said,</p><p>“It was the most perfect, romantic proposal I could ever ask for. We were in Paris on a boat in the Seine River. We had a violin player, champagne and roses. It felt like time stood still, and it was just the two of us in the moment.”</p><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=490 data-injectable=true>However, almost a year later in Feb. 2023, the couple reportedly called off their engagement. The reason hasn’t been specified yet except that the pair was in an on-again-off-again relationship for the past two months.</p><p data-characters=135 data-current-count=135 data-injectable=false>The couple seems to be doing their own thing for now.
