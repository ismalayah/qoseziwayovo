Oh, and there was the<a href=#>&nbsp;epic fight that broke out</a> during a family dinner between Pedro, Chantel's brother River, and <a href=#>Pedro's sister Nicole</a> that made for one heck of a reality television episode.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2019, the couple landed a spinoff titled&nbsp;<a href=#>"The Family Chantel,"</a>&nbsp;a series that dives deeper into the problems both families face as well as how the couple continues to navigate married life.&nbsp;</p><p>In Season 3 of "The Family Chantel," Pedro was on a quest to find the father that abandoned him, which led him to meet his half-brothers for the very first time. However, per&nbsp;<a href=#>All About the Tea</a>, fans reportedly uncovered a photo on Instagram that showed Pedro and Chantel with his two half-brothers in 2014... which was way before the season filmed. Many viewers weren't happy about feeling misled, but the show carried on.&nbsp;Per a TLC press release, Season 4 of "The Family Chantel" landed a premiere date of June 6, 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcWplZ353e8Waop6rpGLAtbvRopysZZ%2Bjenp8jJ2YsmWWnq6vr8Ro</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
