Mazursky makes the most of that paradox, and gradually we see the buried theme of the movie emerging, and it is the power of friendship. What these people all really lacked, rich and poor, sane and crazy alike, was the power to really like other people.</p><p>The movie should get some kind of award for its casting. Dreyfuss, who has been so good in the past as a hyperactive overachiever, succeeds here in slightly deflecting that energy. He has the success, but is bedazzled by it, as if not quite trusting why great wealth should come to him for doing so little. He channels his energy, not into work, but into enthusiasms - and Nolte becomes his greatest enthusiasm.</p><p>For Bette Midler, Barbara Whiteman is the perfect character, all filled with the distractions of living up to her level of consumption.</p><p>Nolte in some ways has the subtlest role to play, although when we first see it, it seems the broadest. His shiftless drifter has to metamorphize into a man who understands his hosts so deeply that he can play them like a piano.</p><p>The supporting roles are so well filled, one after another, that we almost feel we recognize the characters before they're introduced.</p><p>And Mike, the dog, should get an honorary walk-on at the Oscars.</p><p>Perhaps I have made the movie sound too serious. Mazursky has a way of making comedies that are more intelligent and relevant than most of the serious films around; his last credit, for example, was the challenging "<a href=#>Moscow on the Hudson</a>." So let me just say that "Down and Out in Beverly Hills" made me laugh longer and louder than any film I've seen in a long time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46dprCmXZa7pXnOrqtmoZ5ir6bCxKujsmWYnrmtv4xqcHFu</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
