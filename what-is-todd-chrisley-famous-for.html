The USA Network show has run for 9 seasons and turned Todd Chrisley into a household name. Dubbed the Southern Kardashians, the Chrisley clan (made up of Todd, Julie, their three children, and two children from Todd’s previous marriage) lived in a Tennessee mansion and drove luxury cars. The family was an impressive picture of great financial success but after news of the couple’s sentencing, we now know that was really just an illusion.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=91 data-current-count=91 data-injectable=false>We may know how the story ends but how did Todd Chrisley become famous in the first place?</p><h2 id=h-why-is-todd-chrisley-famous data-injectable=false>Why is Todd Chrisley famous?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=579 data-current-count=970 data-injectable=true>Before Chrisley Knows Best was picked up, Todd Chrisley had already made a name for himself in the real estate business. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a>, Chrisley’s first wife — high school sweetheart Teresa Terry — tells the publication Chrisley was interested in interior design from a young age. Coming from an average, middle-class upbringing, Chrisley reportedly stood out in their hometown of Westminster, South Carolina. As a teen, he was more interested in fashion and appearances than the majority of their peers and turned that love for design into a career.</p><p data-characters=547 data-current-count=547 data-injectable=true>Chrisley first became interested in refurbishing houses when he was in his twenties and soon began flipping them. This soon turned into a full-fledged career and he initially made a fortune with his real estate firm. However, it was not smooth sailing for the Chrisley family patriarch. He and Terry would finalize their divorce in 1996 after she filed a domestic violence complaint two years prior and in 2008, Chrisley’s real estate business would get hit hard by the financial crisis. By 2012, he filed bankruptcy and closed his company.</p><p data-characters=144 data-current-count=144 data-injectable=false>A few years later, Chrisley was approached by All3Media and Maverick TV to start his own reality show based on his family. He told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">OK Magazine</a>,</p><p>“I always knew there was some crazy, but they felt like it was a show. They asked to do a sizzle reel, and I didn’t know what that was. We agreed to it, and really it was okay if nothing came from it. It wasn’t going to change my life… then they came back and said, ‘We’ve been wanting to stay away from you guys. But I just want you to know we presented this to ten different networks, and we have nine offers.’ And so I thought, Wow, the world really does have a desire for crazy.”</p><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=279 data-injectable=false>The world evidently did desire crazy and the show brought new levels of fame to Chrisley and the rest of his family. The show also opened them up for public scrutiny and when Chrisley and his wife were first indicted for fraud and tax evasion in 2019, the whole world found out.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=579 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Todd Chrisley (@toddchrisley)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=116 data-current-count=116 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chrisley began his 12-year prison sentence in Jan. 2023</a> and is currently being held at a federal prison in Florida.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKKrXam8pbCMnJ%2BroaOhsrp5xZqkqK2jYrOwvo4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
