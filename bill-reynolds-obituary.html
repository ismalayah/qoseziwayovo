He was 78 years old.</p><p>Reynolds was a basketball star for Barrington High School and Brown University in the 1960s and continued playing pick-up ball throughout his life. He joined the Providence Journal in 1981 and moved to the sports department a few years later. He became one of the most respected and influential sports writers in Rhode Island and beyond.</p><p>His long-running Saturday column – For What It’s Worth – was a must-reading for Journal subscribers. In it, he’d opine on the sports stories of the day, as well as his favorite books, movies, and just about anything else that crossed his mind. Providence College basketball, the Celtics, Red Sox, Patriots, the Independent Man and out-of-state license plates at RI beaches were common themes.</p><p>Reynolds also authored several books — “Hope: A School, A Team, A Dream,” “Fall River Dreams,” “Basketball Junkie” and “Born to Coach” which he co-wrote with Rick Pitino, were just a few. He also collaborated with former NBA player Chris Herren on his memoir of addiction and recovery.</p><p>Reynolds stepped away from full-time duties at The Journal in the summer of 2019, after starting as a reporter in the paper’s Newport bureau in 1981. He fully retired from the newspaper in early 2021.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bill Reynolds’ Cause of Death</h2><p>According to Kevin McNamara, a former colleague, and friend of Reynolds, he was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">battling Alzheimer’s disease</a> for several years. He passed away peacefully at his home surrounded by his family.</p><p>McNamara wrote a heartfelt tribute to Reynolds on Twitter, calling him “a giant in our business” and “a mentor to so many.” He also shared some of his favorite memories of working with Reynolds, such as covering the Final Four together and having lunch at Angelo’s on Federal Hill.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bill-Reynolds-Cause-of-Death.jpg><p>Many other journalists, athletes, coaches, and fans also expressed their condolences and admiration for Reynolds on social media.
