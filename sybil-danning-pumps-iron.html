As for Sybil Danning, you know all about her from her famous cover of Playboy, in which she posed in the leather harness, and from her celebrated feud with her co-star in &#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Or, as Dacy would put it, even more famous. Dacy is the kind of guy who leaves telephone messages to tell you that he will be calling you next week with news about Sybil Danning.</p><p>As for Sybil Danning, you know all about her from her famous cover of Playboy, in which she posed in the leather harness, and from her celebrated feud with her co-star in "<a href=#>Hercules</a>," <a href=#>Lou Ferrigno</a>, who let the other gladiators take off their cloaks, but made Sybil keep hers on, for fear she would upstage his muscles. And that was before Sybil had muscles of her own, which she certainly does now.</p><p>"Look at this," said Dacy, unrolling a poster of Sybil wearing a camouflage bikini and carrying a machinegun, her muscular calves astride the jungle.</p><p>"Sybil, you've been pumping iron," I said.</p><p>"This is the poster for my own video line," she said. "It is called 'Sybil Danning's Adventure Video.' I do the wraparound, introducing each movie and discussing it after it is over. We're going to release four movies every two months. The first four are out in January. What I do in the wrap around is like what Elvira does with horror movies, and <a href=#>Joan Collins</a> with her video line."</p><p>"What movies will you be introducing?"</p><p>"My range is very wide. Westerns, period pictures, chase and gangster movies, something for everybody. I wear different costumes suitable to the films. For 'Space 1999,' for example, I have a silver outfit and I carry a ray gun."</p><p>"I must have missed 'Space 1999' when it came out," I said.</p><p>"Sybil comes on," Dacy said, "and says, I'm Sybil Danning. No man, no war, no country can stop me from being your host on this series! It's a little tongue-in-cheek. The response has been encouraging. We've been asked if we'll also start a cable series, but I think that's a bad idea. You want buyers to know they're getting something they couldn't get on TV. Joan Collins, for example, has actually been detrimental to video sales. Why should they pay for her when they get her free?"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmoqakmr%2B3tcSwqmirqZe2rXnDmqWnoZ6cerHBzKmqZqGipLs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
