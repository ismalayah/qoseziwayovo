Starring <a href=#>Charlyne Yi</a>, Eric Andre, and <a href=#>Peter Weller</a>, the short dabbles in the same austere, atmospheric storytelling of Cosmatos' previous work, focusing on strange exchanges accompanied by a rich synthesizer score (courtesy here of <a href=#>Daniel Lopatin</a>). The short’s haziness can make it drag, but it’s long into its duration before one wonders just what the hell is going to happen. Plus, Cosmatos creates a hypnotic effect by shooting on film, garnering soft yellow light and heavy shadows on Weller’s face, while making for a respite from numbing digital crispness that other “Cabinet of Curiosities” installments can suffer from.&nbsp;</p><p>The last installment, at least for this "season" of "Cabinet of Curiosities," depicts a married couple who share a love for studying dunlin birds, but have grown apart after a tragedy they can't talk about. That emotional burden is a large part of the slow burn in "<strong>The&nbsp;Murmuring</strong>"&nbsp;which director Jennifer Kent actualizes as a gothic story with saturated costumes and peaceful wide shots of the two studying the mysterious group actions of birds. Based on a short story by Del Toro (with Kent adapting the teleplay), the short goes for the heart with its scenes of a tense marriage, which are more striking than the horror beats and bumps in the night&nbsp;that Kent eventually relies on.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmrKyimq6utc2gZqCtmaG5pr7MqGSdnZxiwbC%2BzqxknJmSnrumwIyonWabpae2sL%2FIraCeq12jsrWyy6KvZqymYr%2BmwsiermZqYGd%2F</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
