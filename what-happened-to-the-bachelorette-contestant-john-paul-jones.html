Well, not long after, they got it.</p><p data-characters=508 data-current-count=809 data-injectable=true>As much as we enjoyed watching John Paul Jones in The Bachelorette, I’d say that we didn’t even get enough time to miss him. In case you don’t remember, it was only a couple of month after his Bachelorette departure that John Paul Jones showed up in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bachelor in Paradise‘s gorgeous location</a>. The season in question (the sixth in this spin-off’s many installments) aired in 2019, and a lot has happened since then. So, what has John Paul Jones been up to during this time period?</p><h2 id=h-what-happened-to-john-paul-jones data-injectable=false>What happened to John Paul Jones?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by John Paul Jones (@johnpauljonesjohnpauljones)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=491 data-current-count=791 data-injectable=true>His appearances in The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise have put this hearthrob in the spotlight, earning him a legion of fans ready to support his every endeavor. However, that doesn’t make his love life any easier. After getting together with Tayshia Adams and splitting up from her in Paradise, the contestant rekindled this relationship after the season wrapped. It was a short-lived romance, though, as the two decided to call it quits in October of 2019, for good that time.</p><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=411 data-injectable=true>It seems as though it wasn’t meant to be, which most people could’ve guessed by witnessing the ups and downs of their relationship during season 6 of Bachelor in Paradise. The fact that they got together in the first place was enough to surprise viewers, so make of that what you will. Since the split, John Paul Jones has had other loves, but it looks like his heart is free at the time of writing.</p><p data-characters=517 data-current-count=517 data-injectable=false>Enough about romance, though. Life is made up of lots of other things, and in this reality star’s case, work is a big part of it. After his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bachelor Nation</a> appearances, John Paul Jones has been making a name for himself in the acting industry, having been in several short films like Bathtub Chronicles, The Recital, and I’m Gonna Be Alright. He has also been in two TV series, Crescent and The Undesirables, so if you miss seeing John Paul Jones’ face on the screen, you can always dive into those.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKGZoKWyr7HDZquoZaSdsm6uwJyfnqSfp7K1wMRmmqimpJrAta3NrWSjp5ijerGt1KVko6eemsBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
