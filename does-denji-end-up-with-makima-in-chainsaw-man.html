In this article, we provide the answer to that question and more, but be warned — <strong>major spoilers to follow</strong>.</p><h2 id=h-do-makima-and-denji-end-up-together data-injectable=false>Do Makima and Denji end up together?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/makima-chainsaw-man-1.jpg><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=521 data-injectable=true>The Chainsaw Man manga is still ongoing, which means no one knows whom Denji will end up with just yet, but we can confirm that it won’t be Makima. In fact, Makima doesn’t even make it to the end of the story.</p><p data-characters=450 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=true>Despite Denji’s devotion to his superior, Makima never actually reciprocates his romantic feelings. She is only interested in the Chainsaw Devil that fused itself with Denji’s body, and is willing to do anything to get to it. In order to use Denji, Makima strings him along with promises of an eventual relationship, while simultaneously threatening to end his life if he falls out of line, because truthfully she does not care for Denji.</p><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>When Makima’s true identity is revealed as the Control Devil, she finally expresses how much Denji irritates her and vows to ruin anything good in his life. She promptly makes good on that promise by taking away his closest friend. In a final confrontation, Denji ends up killing Makima and eating her body, despite still having feelings for her. Anything for the greater good, right?</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=600 data-injectable=false>If you’d like to continue following Chainsaw Man‘s story in its animated version, tune in to Crunchyroll.
