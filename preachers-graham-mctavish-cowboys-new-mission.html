On this past Sunday’s penultimate episode, we saw The Saint relive his own personal Hell over and over again until Fiore and Deblanc pay him a little visit with an offer he really can’t refuse: seek out and kill Jesse Custer, and his torment will end."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I love the fact that the worlds collide and there’s suddenly a sense made of what’s going on. They give him the opportunity to continue his vengeance with the job they’re offering. He doesn’t know who this preacher is. All he’s told is there’s a job for him and he needs to kill somebody. He doesn’t ask any questions. He doesn’t care! [Laughs] The fact that he’s being sent out to kill a man of God is a bonus for him.”</p><p data-characters=181 data-current-count=428 data-injectable=false>No doubt The Saint is a formidable force, but will even he be able to resist Jesse Custer’s “word”?
