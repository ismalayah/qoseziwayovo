The future of Real Housewives has become a hot topic as the series prepares for its thirteenth season following a gruesome Season 12.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=459 data-current-count=459 data-injectable=true>Many reports of the show have been stirring up its cast, and many popular housewives, including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lisa Rinna</a> and Diana Jenkins, are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">announcing their exits</a> from the show after the intense three-part reunion that aired back in late 2022. But rest assured, Kyle Richards, along with Erika Jayne, Garcelle Beauvais, Dorit Kemsley, Crystal Kung Minkoff, and Sutton Stracke, will return to Real Housewives and make Season 13 a memorable one despite the cast cut-offs.</p><p data-characters=196 data-current-count=196 data-injectable=false>In March 2023, Kyle stated <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with ET</a>, explaining that “there are going to be some faces missing this season,” but Season 13 won’t be any less drama or entertainment. She added:</p><p>“It’s always interesting to see how the dynamics shift, as other people come and go, and it makes for an interesting show. And it’s interesting to watch now how people who didn’t get along, do, or the ones that did, now don’t. Just changes everything.”</p><h2 id=h-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills-season-13-release-date data-injectable=false>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Season 13 release date</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/RHOBH-Season-8-Reunion.jpg><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=617 data-injectable=true>As for when exactly Real Housewives will return to the Bravo screen, Garcelle Beauvais confirmed in March 2023 that&nbsp;filming for Season 13 had already begun&nbsp;in February 2023. She added that fans could expect the “old school&nbsp;Beverly Hills&nbsp;in terms of glamour and fun” in the upcoming season to raise excitement.</p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=309 data-injectable=false>As of June 2023, the filming for The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Season 13 has officially wrapped up, and viewers may anticipate getting their first peek at the new season in the following months. Teasing the release date of RHOBH Season 13, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Beauvais spoke at the Banff World Media Festival</a> in June 2023:</p><p>“I’m hearing November is our release date. It’s back to fun and glamour and friendships. It’s not as toxic as it was. I think the last season was pretty hardcore on everybody.”</p><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=290 data-injectable=false>So, fans can expect the season to hit the screens this November, though no official word on the release date has been made public so far.
