Yup, no doubt about it, Ortega stands head and shoulders above many of her contemporaries.</p><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>Well, metaphorically speaking, that is, as Ortega’s actually exceptionally short. When Wednesday first premiered in fall 2022, viewers were stunned by her small stature, convinced that there had to be some digital or practical effects employed to make her appear younger, as per the role requiring her to portray a teenager. But how tall is Jenna Ortega really?</p><h2 id=h-jenna-ortega-s-height-explained data-injectable=false>Jenna Ortega’s height, explained</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1703124526-1.jpg><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=322 data-injectable=false>Ortega’s (lack of) height is very noticeable in Wednesday, with some viewers believing there may have been some Lord of the Rings-style visual trickery utilized to achieve the feat. Or else director Tim Burton used some clever shot-framing in order to make her appear shorter. In fact, the reality is very different.</p><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=703 data-injectable=true>The actress — who has already become synonymous with the supernatural and hitched to the horror genre despite being just into her 20s — may be wise beyond her years, but tall she is not. The 21-year-old stated that she is roughly 5 foot 1 inches tall during one of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired’s Auto-Complete Interviews</a>, in which she answered a variety of commonly Googled questions about her.</p><p data-characters=177 data-current-count=177 data-injectable=false>Ortega’s height is part of what makes her so convincing as teen characters, but at some point she’s bound to outgrow such roles. Again, figuratively, not literally.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1sMOMrZilpF2ewG62xKelmmWfp8Gms8Bmrp6cnprApa3YZqqtmaKoeqmxyKCfrWWVrb2trcinnJ1n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
